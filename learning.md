# Learning process

- Read Wiki article about some tool
- Explore text/video tutorials about this tool
- Read the official tool manual

## Favourite channels

When I learn DevOps-related things or anything else I often watch some YouTube channels from native English speakers:

{% include_relative _templates/link_bullet_list.liquid items=site.data.channels %}

Doing so allows me not forget English and upgrade my listening skills although most videos on these channels have simple English.

## Favourite tutorial sites

Also I use the following sites from time to time:

{% include_relative _templates/link_bullet_list.liquid items=site.data.text_tutorials %}
